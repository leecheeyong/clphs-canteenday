**Coding Journey of the CLPHS Canteen Day 2024 Landing Page**

## 🧠 What I Learned from Building the Canteen Day Website

This was more than just a school project—it was a real-world application with real users, timelines, feedback, and expectations. Here are some key lessons and reflections from building [canteenday.vercel.app](https://canteenday.vercel.app).

## 🛠️ Technologies Explored

* **Vue.js**: Learned how to structure components effectively, use props and emit events, and manage state reactively.
* **TailwindCSS**: Greatly sped up styling. Learned to think in utility classes and embrace mobile-first, responsive design.
* **Boxicons** and other libraries: Used icons and animations to make the site more engaging and intuitive.
* **Figma to Code**: Translated a full UI/UX prototype into production-ready code with pixel accuracy.

## ⚡ Challenges I Faced

* **Design to Implementation:** Matching the Figma design exactly in responsive Vue components was harder than expected, especially for layout alignment and text scaling on small screens.
* **Project Scope Creep:** Initially simple, but more ideas came into mind, though some of them were unnecessary.
* **Last-Minute Feedback:** With the event approaching, I had to iterate quickly based on feedback from both teachers and students.
* **Performance:** Optimizing image sizes and animations for fast loading on mobile was a challenge, but crucial for the user experience.

## ✨ Highlights

* 🔥 Deployed a **fully working live website** on a custom domain.
* 🎨 Crafted an **interactive experience** that reflected the school’s branding and event energy.
* 📱 Focused on **mobile usability**, knowing most students would use their phones to view the site.
* 🧩 Integrated various **open source tools** to accelerate development while learning how to balance flexibility and control.

## 💬 What I Would Do Differently

* Use a CMS or content API to make updating event info easier for non-developers.
* Add a language toggle (EN/中文) to improve accessibility.
* Automate image optimization and use lazy loading for even better performance.
* Write more unit tests, especially for critical UI interactions.
* Use of AI which is now broadly available.

## 🙌 Acknowledgement

Big thanks to my committee members and friends who contributed ideas, helped with testing, and gave continuous feedback. Also thanks to the open source community—without these libraries, building this project at this speed would have been impossible.

## 🚀 Final Reflection

This project taught me what it means to ship something real—**to design, build, test, and launch** under pressure. I gained confidence not only in coding, but in project planning, design translation, and working with user feedback.

It’s an experience I’ll never forget, and it makes me want to build even more.
